=========================
Programming with Assembly
=========================

* With the use of an assembler, generating the machine code for the ESAP system becomes easier
* Once the assembly language is written, it can be *assembled* into the machine code, that can be loaded into RAM



Revisiting Problems
===================

* Consider the problems already solved with machine code hex files
* Instead of writing machine code, the assembler allows one to write in the assembly language

    * The mnemonics can be used, making programming easier and making the program much easier to understand


* The assembly language is then assembled, with the assembler, to the machine code
* This machine code can then be loaded into the ESAP system for execution


Arithmetic
----------

* Consider the problem of outputting the result of the calculations ``31 + 32`` and ``31 - 32``

    * This problem was already discussed in the machine code topic






Counting
