=========================
Programming with Assembly
=========================

* With the use of an assembler, generating the machine code for the ESAP system becomes easier
* Once the assembly language is written, it can be *assembled* into the machine code, that can be loaded into RAM



Revisiting Problems
===================

* Consider the problems already solved with machine code hex files
* Instead of writing machine code, the assembler allows one to write in the assembly language

    * The mnemonics can be used, making programming easier and making the program much easier to understand


* The assembly language is then assembled, with the assembler, to the machine code
* This machine code can then be loaded into the ESAP system for execution


Arithmetic
----------

* Consider the problem of outputting the result of the calculations ``31 + 32`` and ``31 - 32``

    * This problem was already discussed in the machine code topic


    .. list-table:: Arithmetic Program
        :header-rows: 1
        :align: center

        * - Assembly
          - Machine Code

        * - .. literalinclude:: arithmetic_31_32.esap
                :language: text
                :lineno-match:

          - .. literalinclude:: arithmetic_31_32.hex
                :language: text
                :lineno-match:


* Above is a table comparing the assembly language program and the corresponding machine code

    * This machine code was generated by the assembler
    * The line numbers do not align here as the hex file requires the ``v2.0 raw`` line


* Notice that the data (``31`` and ``32``) is stored at the end of RAM

    * This is not a requirement
    * Although the Von Neumann architecture has instructions and data share the same memory space
    * It is often desirable to try to physically separate instructions and data in some way

        * May help with interpretability of programs


* Also notice the ``NOOP``\s filling the space between the instructions and data

    * The assembler ignores white space, so any empty RAM addresses need to be explicitly set

        * This was done here to facilitate physically separate instructions and data


    * Technically anything could be put in these addresses, data or instruction, as they follow ``HALT``

        * The system would never be able to run these RAM addresses


    * However, to make the program as clear and intentional as possible, ``NOOP``\s were used

        * Entering the data ``0x00`` would also work, as it is the same bit pattern as ``NOOP``
        * However, again, to make the assembly program more clear, ``NOOP`` is used


* Finally, notice the use of hex values to specify addresses, but decimal for the data

    * All values are in hex except ``31`` and ``32``
    * This is not a requirement as the assembler converts everything to the same machine code, regardless of base
    * This decision was made here to help provide clarity to the program


Counting
--------

* Below is the program to count by ones forever

    * Like the above arithmetic problem, this was already discussed in the machine code topic


    .. list-table:: Counting Forever Program
        :header-rows: 1
        :align: center

        * - Assembly
          - Machine Code

        * - .. literalinclude:: counting_forever.esap
                :language: text
                :lineno-match:

          - .. literalinclude:: counting_forever.hex
                :language: text
                :lineno-match:



Check 10
--------

* Below is the program to check if a number is ``< 10``

    * This was discussed in the conditions and conditional jump topics


    .. list-table:: Check ``< 10`` Program
        :header-rows: 1
        :align: center

        * - Assembly
          - Machine Code

        * - .. literalinclude:: check_10.esap
                :language: text
                :lineno-match:

          - .. literalinclude:: check_10.hex
                :language: text
                :lineno-match:


* In the above program, like before, the value to check is stored in address ``0xF``

    * To check if a different value is less than 10, one would have to alter the code


* Here, addresses ``0xD`` and ``0xE`` store the value to be output based on if the value is less than 10 or not

    * Storing the value ``0`` is not strictly necessary here for several reasons, but it does help with intentionality

        * It's not needed because the ESAP system in Digital starts with a ``0`` in the output register
        * Further, the ``NOOP``\s are ``0``, so any of those addresses could be used


* Again, ``NOOP``\s are included to allow separation of the instructions and data
