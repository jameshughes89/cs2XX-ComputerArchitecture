Latches and Flip-Flops
**********************

* The combinational logic topic covered circuits that did not store or require any stored data to operate
* Here, circuits capable of storing data for later use will be covered
* These can later be used to construct more complex circuits that make decisions based on a series of possible states



Set-Reset Latch (S-R Latch)
===========================

* The most basic one is an SR latch
* IMAGE

* Can also be designed with NANDs

* The trick here is that it has feedback into itself

* Truth table

* Quiet state, but unstable
* Set
* Reset
* Both on means nothing


S-R Latch with Enable
---------------------

* Sometimes we want to control when the latch is actually "enabled"
* Show image
* Show truth table?

* Oscillating state
* But really, there's no need to try to set and reset at the same time...



Data Latch (D Latch)
====================



D Flip-Flop
