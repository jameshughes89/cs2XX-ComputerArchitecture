Combinational Logic
*******************

* With an understanding of logic gates, more complex logic structures can be constructed
* Here, structures that can make decisions based on some combination of inputs will be explored



Decoders
========



Multiplexers (Mux)
==================

* What they do
* Why they are important

* Show idea with truth table (use X to mean whatever)

* Small then bigger
* Generalizes 2**n input to n output
* Why the OR gate?

    * Not really necessary in digital, but bad not to do in reality (details beyond the scope of the course)
    * We will use them as it's common, even in simulators


* Show symbol





Programmable Logic Arrays
=========================



Functional Completeness
=======================



For Next Time
