* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Starting with Digital
=====================

#. Download and uncompress Digital, the simulation software used in this course

    * Digital can be downloaded from `here <https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/releases/latest/download/Digital.zip>`_
    * Be sure to save it somewhere useful
    * Don't forget to uncompress the file


#. Run Digital

    * Open the uncompressed folder and run it
    * On Windows, run the executable (exe) file
    * On Mac or Linux, run the bash (sh) file or java archive (jar) file from a terminal

        * ``./Digital.sh``
        * ``java -jar Digital.jar``


    * You may require a java runtime environment to run the software

        * Digital should prompt for a download if necessary


#. Skip the tutorial for now

    * The tutorial will be done shortly


#. Place an input and output on the workspace and connect them with a wire

    * Input components can be found through the top menu "Components -> IO -> Input"
    * Output components can be found in the same menu
    * Wires are added by clicking and then moving the mouse around the workspace
    * Have the input and output components such that a single, straight horizontal wire connects them


#. Run the circuit and interact with the input button

    * Select the play button to run the circuit



Interacting with the Workspace
==============================

#. Make a copy of the circuit

    * This can achieved easily by selecting the whole circuit with a click and drag, copy, and paste
    * Once selected, copy with the hotkey ctrl + c
    * Paste with ctrl + p


#. Remove the copy by performing undo commands

    * Undo can be done with the hotkey ctrl + z
    * Redo can be done with ctrl + y


#. Move the output higher or lower such that the input and output are not on the same line

    * This can easily be done by selecting a portion of the circuit to move with a click and drag
    * Then, click and drag the selected portion of the circuit up or down
    * Be mindful to have the output component and the wire selected before moving it

        * Otherwise the output will disconnect from the circuit


#. After doing this, the wire is likely diagonal; however, ideally the wires are kept horizontal and vertical only

#. Delete the wire and add a new wire that is made up of only vertical and horizontal segments

#. Now try to move the output component around, while staying connected to the circuit, without adding diagonal segments

    * Be mindful of what segments of the wire are selected before dragging them around the workspace
    * This takes some getting used to
    * If diagonals are appearing, try re-selecting different segments of the wire


#. Excluding the "Components" menu, explore the different top menus and options within them,

    * Play around with the options and settings to see what they do



Tutorial
========

#. Delete everything or create a new file

#. Run the tutorial

    * The tutorial can be started by selecting "View -> Start Tutorial"


#. As the tutorial instructed, run the circuit and interact with it in real time

#. Re-run the circuit in "Single Gate Stepping" mode and see how this differs from running the circuit regularly

    * Make use of the "Gate Step" button


#. Stop the circuit open the analyze window and make sense of what it shows

    * Found in "Analysis -> Analysis"


#. Add a Data Graph component to the workspace, re-run the circuit, and interact with the inputs

    * The Data Graph component is found under "Component -> IO -> Data Graph"
    * The Data Graph component does not need to be connected to anything



Explore Components
==================

Much of these are complex, and many we will build towards
for now we are playing around

Start using and interacting with the components
see if you can get them working and see if you can make sense of what they are doing
some compoents have settings you can modify if you ricjt click on them
If you are stuck, right click the component and select HELP for a description



Digital's Example Files
=======================

Load up some and play with several of the example file sprovided with Digital
They are within the Digital example folder's
There are a lot, but go ghrough and open those that look interesting
run them and interact with them if you can



Playing
=======

Play around within Digital and see what you can build
Work together, ask questions, have fun
