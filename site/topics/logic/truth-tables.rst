* Much of the following will likely be a review of already well understood concepts
* This content is covered for completeness, but will be kept at a relatively high level



Boolean Logic
=============

* Boolean logic is a form of algebra that operates on boolean values that can take on only two states
* These states are typically called *True* and *False*

    * Depending on context, these are sometimes referred to as *On*/*Off*, ``1``/``0``, or *high voltage*/*low voltage*


* Within the algebra, the *operands* are values that take on one of these two states
* The *operators* act on these operands to produce a new boolean value

.. note::

    If this terminology is throwing you off, remember that this is like the integer operators/operands you are familiar
    with. Consider the expression :math:`1 + 2` --- the operands here are integers :math:`1` and :math:`2` and the
    operator is :math:`+`, which means addition. Here, addition is an operator that takes two integer values and
    produces a new integer value.

    With boolean logic, the operands can have one of two boolean values as opposed to an infinite number, like with
    integers, and the operators will take two boolean values to produce a new boolean value.
