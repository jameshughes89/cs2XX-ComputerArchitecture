Electricity and Transistors
***************************

* When talking about electricity and semiconductors, things can get rather nuanced and complex
* However, the level of detail covered for this topic will be kept appropriate for the course content
* As such, certain analogies and ideas will be used that are technically inaccurate, but sufficient for our needs



Electricity
===========

* Electricity is a form of energy that results as a consequence of charged particles moving around

* Electrons are negatively charged particles that can move around
* Protons are positively charged particles that don't move around

* Particles with the same charge repel one another

    * For example, electrons repel other electrons


* However, particles with different charges attract one another

    * Electrons are attracted to protons


* Substances that are effective at transmitting electric charge are called *conductors*

    * Substances that are not effective at transmitting electric charge are called *insulators*


* Copper, along with several other metals, are good conductors due to how the particles chemically bond to one another
* As a result of these bonds, the substance has an abundance of *free electrons*
* These electrons can move relatively easily when a charge is applied to it
