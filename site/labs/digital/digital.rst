* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Starting with Digital
=====================

download digital and uncompress it

    on windows, can run exe
    on Mac and Linux, you can run the bash script


skip the totorial for now
    will come back to this later


Place an input and output and connect them

    components -> io -> input
    components -> io -> output

    click in the work space to start making a wire


Run the circuit and interact with it
    click input button


Make a copy of the circuit
    click and drag to select and copy (ctrl-c)
    paste with ctrl p


Make one of the circuits have the input and output not on the same horizontal line
    Do this by selecting and dragging


Ideally, wires should be horizontal or vertical, so do it like this


Try to move the input and/or output around without causing diagonal wires and not redrawing the wires
    this takes getting used to
    be mindful which segment of the wires are selected before clicking and dragging


excluding the components mnue, look through the menues
    much of this we wont use, but still look
    play around with things, interacti with the software to get a sense of what things do




Tutorial
========

delete everything, or create a new file

Run the totorial
    if you miss it, it's under the menue View


run the circuit and see how the output reacts in real time
try to run in gate step mode

open the analyze menu
    Analysis -> Analysis
    It's showing the truth table for the circuit


add a graph data component and run again and interact with the circuit



Explore Components
==================

Much of these are complex, and many we will build towards
for now we are playing around

Start using and interacting with the components
see if you can get them working and see if you can make sense of what they are doing
some compoents have settings you can modify if you ricjt click on them
If you are stuck, right click the component and select HELP for a description



Digital's Example Files
=======================

Load up some and play with several of the example file sprovided with Digital
They are within the Digital example folder's
There are a lot, but go ghrough and open those that look interesting
run them and interact with them if you can



Playing
=======

Play around within Digital and see what you can build
Work together, ask questions, have fun
