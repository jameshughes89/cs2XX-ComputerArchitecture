Registers and RAM
*****************

* D flip-flops allow one to store a single bit of information
* However, they always updates what's stored on every clock pulse
* Typically, one wants more control over *when* the stored data in the D flip-flop is updated
* In other words, there needs to be a way to control when data is stored, independent of the clock pulses
