Program Counter
===============

* As of now, only data was stored in RAM
* However, RAM will eventually be used to store instructions in addition to data

    * Although, instructions are data


* These instructions are retrieved from RAM one at a time, and the system then executes the instruction
* The program counter is a component that keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction

    * It effectively keeps track of which *line* of the program is to be run next
