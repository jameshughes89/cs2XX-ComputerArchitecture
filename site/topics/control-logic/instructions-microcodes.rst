===========================
Instructions and Microcodes
===========================

* Although RAM has currently only held data, computation has been performed on the system
* With careful manipulation of the control signals, specific operations were executed by the system

    * Reading and writing to RAM
    * Performing arithmetic
    * Outputting values
    * Looping


* Realizing this, it becomes possible to create a set of well defined instructions for the system



Constraints
===========

8 bit computer
this is one of the biggest limitations of what we are building
will be turnig complete though

8 bits to specify instruction and an operand
need to be able to index RAM, so we need 4 bits for operand
thus we have 4 bits for instructions
meaning we can have a total of 16 instructions
this is fine. We don't need much to be turing complete



Microcodes
