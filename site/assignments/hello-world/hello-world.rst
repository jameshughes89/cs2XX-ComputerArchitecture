==============================



Some Hints
==========

* Work on one part at a time
* Some parts of the assignment build on the previous, so get each part working before you go on to the next one
* Test each design as you build it

    * This is a really nice thing about programming; you can run your design and see what happens
    * Mentally test before you even write --- what does this design do? What problem is it solving?


* If you need help, ask

    * Drop by office hours



Some Marking Details
====================

.. warning::

    Just because your design produces the correct output and the tests pass, that does not necessarily mean that you
    will get perfect, or even that your design is correct.


Below is a list of both *quantitative* and *qualitative* things we will look for:

* Correctness?
* Did you follow instructions?
* Comments?
* Label names?
* Design, layout, and style?
* Did you do weird things that make no sense?



What to Submit to Moodle
========================

* Submit your completed *.dig* files to Moodle

    * Do **not** compress the files


.. warning::

    Verify that your submission to Moodle worked. If you submit incorrectly, you will get a 0.
