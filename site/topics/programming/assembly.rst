* With the ability to make decisions, the ESAP system is now complete
* However, using the ESAP system is not particularly easy as it's programmed with machine code

    * Writing programs for the ESAP system is tedious
    * Machine code is prone to errors and and requires memorizing bit patterns


* A solution to this problem is to improve the way programming is done

    * Instead of binary patterns or hex numbers, english mnemonics can be used
    * Other quality of life features can be included, like separating opcode mnemonic from the operand value


* However, the ESAP system ultimately requires machine code
