==========
Conditions
==========

* Although the system is programmable, it currently has a significant limitation
* To highlight this limitation, consider the problem the following problem

    * Given some number, output ``1`` if it is less than ``10``, otherwise, output ``0``


* It turns out that it's not possible as there is no way to check a condition

    * Think ``If`` statements



Conditional Jump Command
========================

need a way to branch based on a condition

    think of what the code would be for the 10 example above
    have code example?



idea of a jump, but only under certain conditions
so, behaviors of the jump needs to change depending on the state of the sytem
for example, if things are equal
    result of operation was 0

We could check if a given value is something
    or after some operation


remembering back the ALU, there were status out

Technically we only need 1 type of condition, but to make things more flexible, it's good to have a few
    zero
    carry
    sign


But.... how do we know? How to check


Status Flags
------------

zero is easy --- are all bits in a number 8?
what about sign?
what about carry?
