What Will I Learn?
==================

* The purpose of this course is to learn how a conventional computer works
* The topic starts with transistors and ends with programming a computer

    :target: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor

    A collection of four transistors. Although these transistors are all physically different, their function is the
    same.


* There are several layers of abstraction between transistors and programming that will be covered

    * Transistors
    * Logic Gates
    * Latches
    * Registers
    * Memory
    * Adders
    * Arithmatic Logic Units (ALUs)
    * Combinatorial and Sequential Logic
    * Control Logic
    * CPUs
    * Architectures
    * Machine Language/Assembly Language
    * Compilers

    High-level idea of the von Neumann architecture. One of the interesting features of this architecture is how memory
    stores both data and instructions.

    High-level idea of the Harvard architecture. This architecture has separate memory for data and instructions.




Resources
=========

* This course only has one required special resource --- *Digital*

    * Free software for simulating digital circuits
    * Available on `GitHub <https://github.com/hneemann/Digital>`_

    Screenshot of a small portion of a modified version of the 8-bit computer designed by Ben Eater. The larger circuit
    is a simulated fully functional and programmable turing complete computer.



Supplementary Resources
-----------------------

* This course has several recommended supplementary resources

    * Not required, but provide additional practice, context, details, etc.


* At tne end of each topic, content from various resources will be suggested


* The course content is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/jameshughes89/cs2XX-ComputerArchitecture>`_

    * There is no requirement to access this content
    * However, students are encouraged to make contributions to the course content


* The textbook *Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits & Gates to C/C++ & Beyond*

    * Not *required*, but for those that like textbooks, it is great


* `Ben Eater has an amazing YouTube playlist where they build a turing complete computer on breadboards <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU>`_

    * These videos are fantastic and provide more details on components than will be covered in this course

* The game `Turing Complete <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/>`_

    * Players incrementally construct and program a turing complete computer
