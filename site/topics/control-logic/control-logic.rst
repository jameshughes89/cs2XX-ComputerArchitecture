=============
Control Logic
=============

* Instructions are fetched and put into the instruction register for processing

    * An instruction set has already been defined
    * Each instruction's microcodes are known

        * How the hardware is manipulated for each instruction


* However, there is still no way for the system to manipulate its own control logic

    * There is no way for the system to take an instruction and then activate/deactivate the various hardware modules


* In other words, how can the system know how to physically perform an instruction
