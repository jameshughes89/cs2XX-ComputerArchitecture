The Bus
*******

* The bus physically connects several components within a computer
* It facilitates the transfer of information between these components, such as RAM and registers

* Typically, there are three types of busses

    * Data bus --- Transfer data between components
    * Address bus --- Transmits memory addresses
    * Control bus --- Sends signals responsible for controlling when components are active


* Depending on the system architecture, these busses can be physically separate or combined
