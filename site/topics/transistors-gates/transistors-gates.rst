Transistors and Logic Gates
***************************

* When talking about electricity and semiconductors, things can get rather nuanced and complex
* However, the level of detail covered for this topic will be kept appropriate for the course content
* As such, certain analogies and ideas will be used that are technically inaccurate, but sufficient for our needs

Transistors
===========

* How they work is outside the scope of this course
* Amplifying or switches
* For our purposes, we think of them as switches
* Different kid of transistors, but the ones we will use are MOSFET

* Negative or Positive transistors, but we will typically use positive

* Simple example

* interesting when put them together



Logic Gates
===========
