* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective



Creating Gates with Universal Operators
=======================================

For these questions, feel free to use a single Digital workspace for all the circuits. However, label each circuit with
labelled rectangles. These are components that can be found under "Components -> Misc. -> Decoration -> Rectangle".

Where possible, each question should have complete tests. The test component can be found under "Components -> Misc. ->
Test case". Once a test component is placed on the workspace, right click on the component to edit the test data.


``NAND``
--------

#. Using only ``NAND``, create a circuit that performs ``NAND``

    * This circuit is intentionally trivial


#. Using only ``NAND``, create a circuit that performs ``NOT``
#. Using only ``NAND`` and ``NOT``, perform ``AND``
#. Using only ``NAND`` and ``NOT``, perform ``OR``
#. Using only ``NAND`` and ``NOT``, perform ``NOR``


``NOR``
-------

#. Using only ``NOR``, create a circuit that performs ``NOR``
#. Using only ``NOR``, create a circuit that performs ``NOT``
#. Using only ``NOR`` and ``NOT``, perform ``OR``
#. Using only ``NOR`` and ``NOT``, perform ``AND``
#. Using only ``NOR`` and ``NOT``, perform ``NAND``
