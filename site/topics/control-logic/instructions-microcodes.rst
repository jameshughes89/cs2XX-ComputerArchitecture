Instructions and Microcodes
===========================

* Although RAM has currently only held data, computation has been performed on the system
* With careful manipulation of the control signals, specific operations were executed by the system

    * Reading and writing to RAM
    * Performing arithmetic
    * Outputting values
    * Looping


* Realizing this, it becomes possible to create a set of well defined instructions for the system
