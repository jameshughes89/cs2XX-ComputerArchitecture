Two's Complement

* As long as enough bits are available, any positive integer (and zero) can be represented

    * With :math:`n` bits, the numbers :math:`0` through :math:`2^{n} - 1` can be represented
    * This would be an *unsigned* integer


* However, how can negative numbers be represented?



Sign Bit
========

everything has been a unsigned so far

show example of the number 5 in a table or something

Addition works the way we expect
you sum up the values of each digit/bit

no way to do negative numbers

use most significant bit as the sign bit
show 5 example

show whole table of all 4/3 bit numbers

problems/limitations are:
1. need to know how many bits there are/what the most significant bit is
    8 bit -5 vs 4 bit -5

2. Two 0s, which is weird

3. Addition is weird
