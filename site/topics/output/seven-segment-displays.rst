Seven Segment Displays

* Binary values from the data bus have been readable through Digital's output components
* However, base 10 is preferable when viewing numbers
* Further, the data on the bus is always changing

    * Sometimes output should persist
    * Not all data on the bus needs to be output


* An output register will be used to improve system outputs
* Seven segment displays will be used as the mechanism for displaying base 10 numbers
