* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective


For these questions, feel free to use a single Digital workspace for all the circuits. However, label each circuit with
labelled rectangles. These are components that can be found under **Components -> Misc. -> Decoration -> Rectangle**.

Where possible, each question should have complete tests. The test component can be found under
**Components -> Misc. -> Test case**. Once a test component is placed on the workspace, right click on the component to
edit the test data.

Questions may have restrictions on the logic gates that may be used. When restrictions are stated, they only apply to
the gates; inputs, outputs, wires, etc. may be still be used.


Doubling and Halving
====================

#. Using an adder, create a circuit to double some 8 bit number

    * Ignore overflows beyond 8 bits


#. Without using an adder, create a circuit to double some 8 bit number

    * **Hint:** This can be done with very few components


#. Create a circuit to half some 8 bit number



Counting Signals
================

Givne 4 inputs, odd signals odd signals

Givne 4 inputs, if more than 2 are high

Given 4 inputs, output the count of the number of signals high in binary
