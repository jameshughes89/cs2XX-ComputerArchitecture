Provided Files
==============

Some empty dig files with tests?



Part 1 --- Non-Digital
======================

This portion of the assignment will not make use of the Digital simulation software. All answers must be typed and use
proper math typesetting, where appropriate.


#. Given the 26 letters of the alphabet

    #. What is the fewest number of bits needed to give each letter a unique bit pattern?
    #. How many bits would be needed for both lowercase and uppercase letters?
    #. How many bits would be needed to identify uppercase and lowercase letters, and numerals (the 10 digits)?


- What is the fewest number of bits needed to encode all 26 lower case letters of the alphabet.
- how many would be needed to encode uppercase and lowercase letters
- With this number of bits, how many more symbols could be added

2.
- Make a table of all 4 bit integers and their decimal value
- show example start of the table

3.
- Convert binary numbers to decimal and show work

4.
- Convert decimal to binary and show work

5.
- convert decimal to hex and show work

6.
add binary numbers and leave results in binary

7.
do bitwise boolean operations

8.
generate truth tables for the following binary expressions

9.
prove the two demorgans with truth table for each

10.
Generate and, or, and not with only nand, and then again with only nor (show with truth table)



Part 2 --- Digital
==================

This portion of the assignment will make use of the Digital simulation software.

1. Make each logic gat ewith N transistors with

2. Make a nand and nor, BUT NOT WITH JUST CHAINING AND/OR AND NOT (limit transistor count)

    with 3 transistors, then with 2

3. implement xor with transistors

4. build demorgans with transistrs

5. With generate and, or, and not with nand, then again with nor



Some Hints
==========

* Work on one part at a time
* Some parts of the assignment build on the previous, so get each part working before you go on to the next one
* Test each design as you build it

    * This is a really nice thing about programming; you can run your design and see what happens
    * Mentally test before you even write --- what does this design do? What problem is it solving?


* If you need help, ask

    * Drop by office hours



Some Marking Details
====================

.. warning::

    Just because your design produces the correct output and the tests pass, that does not necessarily mean that you
    will get perfect, or even that your design is correct.


Below is a list of both *quantitative* and *qualitative* things we will look for:

* Correctness?
* Did you follow instructions?
* Comments?
* Label names?
* Design, layout, and style?
* Did you do weird things that make no sense?



What to Submit to Moodle
========================

* Submit any necessary PDF files to Moodle

    * Submissions for the non-digital portion of assignments that are not PDFs will not be marked
    * PDFs must be generated from typed documents

        * No PDFs of written work


    * If necessary, save or print word processor files as PDFs


* Submit your completed Digital (*.dig*) files to Moodle

    * Do **not** compress the files


.. warning::

    Verify that your submission to Moodle worked. If you submit incorrectly, you will get a 0.
