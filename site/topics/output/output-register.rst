===============

* The look up tables provides a simple way to convert binary numbers to their seven segment display patterns
* Now, a register will be incorporated into the design to provide control over which data is being output to the display



Output Module
=============

We have a LUT and output
Like with the RAM module, we need a way to seperate a value form the bus --- reg

The signed signal reall yis treated like a control signal
