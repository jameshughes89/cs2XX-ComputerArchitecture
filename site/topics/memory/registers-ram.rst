Registers
=========


Storing a Byte
--------------



Random Access Memory
====================

Already discussed the idea

SHOW IMAGE

we can use registers
    Here, we use 1 bit registers

We use a decoder to select which memory address is active

    Notice how the decoded lines activate a whole memory address's REG

We use a mux to relay the selected memory address

    Need one mux/bit


SHOW IMAGE



Same idea as above, but
Add a clock
Added controllable inputs
    data in
    addresses

A way to contorl writes
a way to control reads


Controlling Writes
------------------


Controlling Reads
