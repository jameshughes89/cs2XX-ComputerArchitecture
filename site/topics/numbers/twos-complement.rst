Two's Complement
****************

* As long as enough bits are available, any positive integer (and zero) can be represented

    * With :math:`n` bits, the numbers :math:`0` through :math:`2^{n} - 1` can be represented
    * This would be an *unsigned* integer


* However, how can negative numbers be represented?
