Program Counter
===============

* As of now, only data was stored in RAM
* However, RAM will eventually be used to store instructions in addition to data

    * Although, instructions are data


* These instructions are retrieved from RAM one at a time, and the system then executes the instruction
* The program counter is a component that keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction

    * It effectively keeps track of which *line* of the program is to be run next



Program Counter Module
======================

keep track of current address
needs to control increment (add 1) (not every clock cycle)
need to be able to get data from it

Also want to be able to add data to it to facilitate jumping around
    looping and conditions
    will be made clear in later topics
