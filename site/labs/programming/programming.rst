Programming
***********

* Feel free to use your laptop
* You are strongly encourage to work with others

    * When you get stuck, ask those sitting around you for help
    * Get used to working together in the labs
    * Peer teaching and peer learning has been empirically shown to be very effective


For these questions, use the ESAP design with conditional jumps
:download:`from here. <../../topics/conditions/esap_alu_ram_output_pc_instruction_control_flag.dig>`

Further, use the assembler
:download:`from here. <../../topics/programming/assembler.py>`



Counting Up and Down
====================

#. Write an assembly program to count from 0 to 255, then from 255 to 0, on repeat

    * :math:`0, 1, 2, ..., 253, 254, 255, 254, 253, ..., 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, ...`
    * Be sure to write the program in assembly, then assemble it with the assembler
    * Run the program on the system to ensure correctness



Multiplication
==============

#. Write a program to perform multiplication

    * To simplify the problem, assume the value will be multiplied by at least 1

        * For example, :math:`15 \times x`, where :math:`x \ge 1`


    * Be sure to write the program in assembly, then assemble it with the assembler
    * Run the program on the system to ensure correctness



Other Programs
==============

#. Try to create various interesting programs for the ESAP system
